I worked with [Replit](https://replit.com) circa 2023, a time when I was hooked on their idea of democratizing access to programming. Their mission was to create the next 10 million developers. They had made access to Replit free for educators, made the best online code editor, created a community for people to share projects, and even built a freelance platform for students to win their first "bounty" and make real money.

As with many companies struggling to profit in the edtech space, Replit decided to pivot, unfortunately leaving behind that mission of empowering students and instead building tools to empower others. I still loved the problems being worked on at Replit and decided to stay for another six months before I moved on, but it had made me realize. **It's really fucking hard to build for students.**
